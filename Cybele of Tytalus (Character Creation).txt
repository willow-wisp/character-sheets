        Spell Binding [Minor, Hermetic] -
            She has been tought the secrets of spell binding, a means by which a magus may imbue a spirit into an object and compel them to sustain the spell indefinitely. See the Mysteries Revised, p.27-28.
        Affinity With Rego [Minor, Hermetic] -
            Her natural skill with the Technique of Commanding means that whenever she generates a Rego study total, she increases it by half its base value, rounded up. At character creation, any experience points she puts into it are also increased by one half, rounded up.
        Affinity With Vim [Minor, Hermetic] -

    Flaws:
        Blatant Gift [Major, Hermetic] -
            People immediately realize there is something strange about her, even if they do not realize she is a Magus, granting her -6 to all interaction rolls with normal people and animals.
        Gender Nonconforming [Minor, Social] -
            While presenting outwardly female in most respects has very little time for other people's opinions on her presentation. She prefers "magos" - the Greek term - to "maga".
        Proud [Major, Personality] -
            The Art is a heady thing, and while Cybele may deign to express her Covenant-mates as her equals, she has no superiors. She is not *quiet* about this opinion.
        Small Frame [Minor, General] -
            She is rather shorter than average, granting her a Size of -1.
        Weakness [Minor, Personality] -

    Spells:
        Coerce the Airy Spirit (ReVi 20) -
            R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind
            Through the use of lurid threats, she may command a spirit to do her bidding. If the spell penetrates the spirit’s Magic Resistance, make a stress roll of Com + Leadership to see how effective the maga’s threats are. The storyguide should always give a bonus or penalty depending on the potency of the threats, but note that any roll other than a botch compels at least minimal obedience, while increasing rolls indicate a more cooperative spirit.
            This spell affects any spirit so long as they are affiliated with the Magic Realm.
            Her Sigil causes spirits so commanded to appear with iron shackles somewhere on their form when perceived.

            Through the invocation of the minor Daimon known as Pukis, so long as this spell penetrates the spell resistance of Pukis (Might 10), an aspect of the Dragon of the Hearth can be summoned.

            R: Special (Voice), D: Special (Momentary), T: Special (Part)
            This spell, a mystery enchantment, invokes a spell spirit, which may cast the equivalent of the spell Pilum of Fire, modified to have a Part target for this purpose. Once invoked, the spirit must be given instructions - which allow for varying the effects of the spell, similar to Flexible Formulaic Magic. The first time this spell is cast after being invented, the spell must penetrate in order to seal the pact.
