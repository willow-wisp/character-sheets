    Spells:
        Call Down The Unworked Iron (CrTe 20)
            D: Momentary, R: Touch, T: Individual
            This ritual creates a massive lump of iron, twenty cubic paces worth. The metal is unworked but pure, or close to. Afanasya's casting sigil, which renders things primal and elemental like the gods she still reveres, means this is meteoric iron.
            (Ritual, Base 5, +1 Touch, Size +2)
        And Into Ingot Shape It (ReTe 15)
            D: Momentary, R: Touch, T: Individual
            This takes a cubic foot of metal from a mass of it and reshapes it. Its intended use is to create metal ingots, but other shapes are possible with Finesse rolls. Afanasya's casting sigil means that the metal is violently pulled from its original mass and magically beaten into shape.
            (Base 5, +1 Touch, +1 Part)
        Carve The Earth's Face (Re(Pe)Te 30)
            D: Concentration, R: Voice, T: Part
            This spell allows the user to cause ten cubic paces of stone that are already part of something to move in a very unnatural fashion while the concentrate, including diminishing it so as to carve the stone. This requires a Dexterity + Finesse roll. The usual use is to carve it into stone blocks, which is an Ease Factor of 6. Afanasya's casting sigil means that this is presaged by the rumbling of the ground as the Earth splits and the stone is pulled out.
            (Base 4, +1 Concentration, +2 Voice, +1 Part, +1 Size, +1 Requisite)
        Wall of Protecting Stone (CrTe 25)
            R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind
            This spell creates a basalt wall 25 paces wide, 1 pace thick, and 4 paces tall. One needs minerâ€™s tools to break through it, though it can be toppled if it is not connected to a support on its side or top. Afanasya's casting sigil causes the wall to erupt from the surface in question, with the texture of a weathered mountainside.
            (Base 3, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 size)
        To Speak With The Earth (InTe 30)
            R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind
            Allows her to talk with natural stone. The stone's answer will feel slow and ponderous, but does not actually take any longer than a normal conversation. Stone, however, is slow to remember, and has difficulties with directions and awareness of quickly moving things like people.
